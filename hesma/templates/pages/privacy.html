However, authorities that may receive personal data in the context of a specific investigation mandate under Union or Member State law shall not be considered as Recipients and the processing of such data by those authorities shall be carried out in accordance with the applicable data protection rules, in accordance with the purposes of the processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>“Third party”</strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body, other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons authorized to process the personal data under the direct responsibility of the controller or processor.

      <strong>Applications</strong>
      <br />
      We are pleased that you want to apply for a job with us. In the following, we would like to explain how we process the personal data you provide to us as part of the application process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What data do we process?</strong> As part of the application process, we collect and process personal data that you provide to us, namely contact and address information, your application photo, information about your career to date, your schooling and vocational training.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The purpose of the processing</strong> is to carry out the application process and the selection of the applicant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>On what legal basis do we process your data?</strong>Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR, namely the implementation of pre-contractual measures, serves as the legal basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We receive the data from you. If we do not collect the personal data directly from you, we will also tell you the source of the personal data and, if applicable, whether it comes from publicly available sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Is your data transmitted to third parties?</strong>As part of the application process, data may be transferred to service providers, group companies and affiliated businesses. Data is only ever shared with third parties within the legally permissible framework and insofar as this is necessary for the implementation of the application process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Storage duration:</strong> We only store your personal data for as long as is necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing or the storage is subject to a legal retention period. In the event that we are unable to offer you a job as a result of the application process, we will delete the data collected in our systems six months after the end of the application process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your rights:</strong> You have the right to a) request information about the processing of your data free of charge, b) receive a copy of your personal data and c) to correct your data. Should your personal data be incomplete, you have the right, while taking into consideration the processing purposes, to complete the data, to have your data deleted or blocked, to have the processing restricted, to object to the processing of your data, to revoke your consent to the processing of your data in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of revocation for sound and image recordings, we will remove the images and videos from all websites that we have access to. In the case of group photos, only individual persons are anonymized. Please note that the revocation of consent does not apply to printed media that have already been printed and distributed. Furthermore, it must be taken into account that photos and film recordings can be accessed worldwide when published online or on social networks. Any further use and/or modification by third parties cannot be ruled out. A total deletion of the published photos and video recordings on the internet can therefore only be ensured on the pages of the responsible party.
